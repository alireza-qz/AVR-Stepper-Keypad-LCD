# Stepper Motor Speed Control with Keypad (AVR)

This project demonstrates controlling a stepper motor using an AVR microcontroller.  
The motor speed is set by the user through a keypad.

---

## Description
- The user enters a value using a keypad.
- Based on the entered value, the stepper motor rotates at different speeds.
- The project is written in C and designed for AVR microcontrollers.
##  How It Works
1. User enters a number using the keypad.
2. The microcontroller reads the input.
3. The stepper motor speed changes according to the entered value.
